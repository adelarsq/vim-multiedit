## About

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of multi-selection editing (like in Sublime Text) for vim.

## Status

It supports only basic editing using insert
mode. Current functionality is demoed in this screencast:

## Future 

Editing multiple regions simultaneously is visually appealing, but I am
personally not convinced that it is more efficient than the usage of other vim
features (block mode, macros, :s, ...). So I will most likely not put any work
into creating a plugin that is ready for daily use. Sorry.
