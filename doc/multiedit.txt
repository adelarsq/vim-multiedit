INTRODUCTION                                          *multiedit-introduction*

This plugin is inspired by Sublime Text's feature that allows editing files
using multiple cursors. It allows you to mark regions and edit them
simultanously.  

Note: while multi-editing is visually appealing, vim offers other mechanism
that are usually more efficient (block mode, macros, search and replace, ...).
